We provide the code/notebooks used in producing the results shown in the "LSST AGN SC Cadence Note: Non-Parametric Structure Function Metric" submitted to the LSST SCOC on April 15th 2021. 

### Quick Access:
1. Scripts for running the structure function error bar metric on the SciServer platform --> Under the `scripts` directory
2. Brief illustration of the developed `SFErrorMetric` --> [Here](./notebooks/00_SFErrorMetric.ipynb)
3. The notebook analyzing the results obtained in the WFD survey --> [Here](./notebooks/02_Analyze_WFD.ipynb)
4. The notebook analyzing the results obtained in the DDFs --> [Here](./notebooks/03_Analyze_DDF.ipynb)
5. The notebook compariing the WFD results within each family --> [Here](./notebooks/04_WFD_Family.ipynb)

### Updates:
**02/17/2022**: New work added after the cadence notes can be found in the [phase2](https://github.com/RichardsGroup/LSST_SF_Metric/tree/phase2) branch.
